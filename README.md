After completing the Demo, please implement another operand. Feel free to be creative! This can be anything like multiplication, subtraction, string concatenation, exponentiation, etc.

Remember to update the database, create a template, register a route, and also add a button to navigate to your operand on your home page.

HINT: take inspiration from the addition function we implemented during the NME!!

Good Luck!
